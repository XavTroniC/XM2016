# XM2016

This software generates a fix frequency TIMER. It can control one PWM output for the hot wire in auto (from PC with program like Jedicut or GMFC) or in manual mode.

It use a Microchip PIC 12F683 programmable chip. More informations and schematic are avalible on my website https://www.xavtronic.ch and article "XM2016". A compiled file is also disponible on my website to burn directly the chip.
